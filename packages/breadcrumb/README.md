# Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs are used for navigating within sections of an app. They communicate information hierarchy and help users follow the path they took to get to their current screen, and provide a way to navigate back to parent screens.

At D2iQ, we style our breadcrumbs with large text because they're used to label pages in the PageHeader component. When at the top level of a section, a breadcrumb will just appear like a regular page title.
