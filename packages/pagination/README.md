# Pagination

A `Pagination` component may be used to navigate through a large colletion of items that is divided into multiple pages.

## Layout

The `Pagination` component should be right-aligned with the list of items it is paging through.

## [WIP] Customizing item count per page

TODO: Work with design team to spec how we use the "items per page" dropdown menu

These usage docs are incomplete. More info about pagination UX is needed from the design team.
