# Card
Cards are used to visually group related content. Cards can be used to make it easier for users to scan a view.

## Aspect ratio
Sometimes we want a card's size to obey a specific aspect ratio. When an aspect ratio is defined, the card's width and height will always follow that proportion unless the content is too high: in which case the card's height will increase.
