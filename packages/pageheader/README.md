# PageHeader

The PageHeader component provides information and actions for the current screen. Designers and developers using a PageHeader can use their judgement to decide whether the PageHeader scrolls with the page content, or is stuck at the top.

## Breadcrumb
The larger left-aligned text lets the user know where in the app they are. Visit the "Breadcrumb" component for more information.

## Actions
Actions appear right-aligned in the PageHeader. When there are too many actions, designers and developers can choose to put some of the less used actions in an overflow menu.

A PageHeader doesn't have to have actions

### Placement
When there is no overflow menu, actions should be ordered right to left from most used to least used.

Example:
[Secondary Action] [Primary Action]

<br />

When there is an overflow menu, the overflow menu button is always on the far right.

Example:
[Secondary Action] [Primary Action] [â‹®]
